## Modes
There are three modes for the configuration. This documentation is written for the Advanced mode.
### Basic
Only shows the most used configuration options.

### Advanced
Shows most things, that you'll need to create your keyboard.

### Expert
Allows to edit the code directly, to enable even more possibilities. See [expert mode](expert.md) for that.

## General
Some setting groups allow you to edit the vaues for one side of the keyboard. When you edit want to edit them together, the values of the left half will be overridden by the values of the right half.
